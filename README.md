Welcome to the Financial Statements Challenge!

In this challenge, you’re tasked with analyzing the financial data of a single SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) company. The dataset includes two key components:
- A detailed transaction history of real income and expenses
- A structured budget plan that sets financial expectations


Challenge Questions: 

The questions below are designed to help you explore different aspects of the company’s financial performance. They’re not requirements, they’re here to guide your thinking and help you focus your analysis.

How does revenue change over time — are there any seasonal peaks or slowdowns?
